YOLO-Strike is a project about the [YOLO framework](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/). The project includes many useful tools for setting up YOLO and a report explaining the YOLO design structure as well as its strengths and weaknesses. In a guide-like structure, we also explain how to train the network using Darknet and other useful scripts. In the report, we furthermore include an application of YOLO where we use it to detect friendly and hostile players in the computer game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

The YOLO-Strike report can be found [here](https://github.com/MathiasThor/YOLO-Strike/blob/master/YOLO_Strike.pdf).

A video showing the detection of friendly and hostile players in the computer game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqjcvi2Q3Io).
