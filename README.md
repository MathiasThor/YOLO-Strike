YOLO-Strike is made as a project at the University of Southern Denmark. In the final project report, we thoroughly explain the YOLO design structure as well as its strengths and weaknesses. In a guide-like structure, we also tell how to train the network using Darknet and other useful scripts. Finally, we applied the knowledge gained from the previous chapters to detect friendly and hostile players in the computer game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. At the end of the report, the reader should be able to apply YOLO to their problem to come up with new and exciting use cases.

The project about YOLO can be found [here](https://github.com/MathiasThor/YOLO-Strike/blob/master/YOLO_Strike.pdf).

A video showing the detection of friendly and hostile players in the computer game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqjcvi2Q3Io).
